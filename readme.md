Rat
===

Rat is a boilerplate web app written in PHP/MySQL.

History
-------

When you start building a web app you usually start with the same functionality: signup, login, change password, create 'items' (whatever they may be), delete items, add friends etc. Rat gives you that functionality straight out of the box. This frees you up to focus on the differentiating parts of your app: the design, making it useful and getting people using it. Why the name Rat? Because it's small, quick and dirty, and ultimately you should probably exterminate it (and replace it with your own code).

Getting started
---------------

1. Copy all files to your application directory
2. Create a MySQL database and run rat.sql in it
3. Rename config/config-sample.php â†’ config/config.php
4. Update the variables in config/config.php, in particular the database variables
5. Visit /admin/setup to create your account
