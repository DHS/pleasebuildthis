Rat
===

Rat is a boilerplate social network written in PHP/MySQL.

History
-------

When you start building a web app you usually start with the same functionality: signup, login, change password, create 'objects' (ie. status updates or images), delete objects etc. Imagine having that functionality straight out of the box. This is Rat. Now you can focus on the differentiating parts of an app: the design, making it useful and getting people using it. Why the name Rat? Because it's small, quick and dirty, and ultimately you should probably exterminate it (replace it with your own code).

Getting started
---------------

1. Copy all files to your application directory
2. Create a MySQL database and run rat.sql in it
3. Rename config/config-sample.php â†’ config/config.php
4. Update the variables in config/config.php, in particular the database variables
5. Visit admin.php to create your account
