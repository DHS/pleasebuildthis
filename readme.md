Rat
===

Rat is a PHP/MySQL boilerplate web app built by David Haywood Smith.

History
-------

When you start building a web app you always start out building the same functionality: signup, login, change password, create a new 'object' (ie. status update or image), delete objects etc. Imagine having that functionality straight out of the box! This is what Rat gives you. Now you can focus on the tricky parts of building a web app: making it useful and getting people using it. 

Getting started
---------------

1. Copy all files to your application directory
2. Create a MySQL database
